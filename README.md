# DrugBank XML Parser

This R script parses the DrugBank full database XML file and extracts several biologically relevant tables, including drug metadata, interactions, SNP-related information, and protein targets.

## 📦 Output Files

The script generates the following CSV files inside the `~/drubank_data/New data/` directory:

- `main_df.csv`: Core drug information
- `interactions_df.csv`: Drug-drug interaction data
- `external_ids_df.csv`: External database identifiers (e.g., ChEMBL, PubChem)
- `snp_effects_df.csv`: SNP effects related to drug response
- `snp_adrs_df.csv`: SNPs associated with adverse drug reactions
- `targets_df.csv`: Drug target proteins and actions

## 🧪 Requirements

The following R packages are required:

```r
install.packages(c("xml2", "dplyr", "purrr", "progress"))
